# Bless

Bugs, cryptic error messages, unexplained crashes, they happen to all of us.

But what many people don't know is that almost 75% of all unexplained crashes are
actually caused by demons and evil spirits.

This is where Bless comes in.

With Bless, you can perform a blessing ritual on your computer to exorcise bugs away.

Depending on your religion / personal beliefs, you can choose pick the god you want to
perform the blessing.

Currently, we only support the god of the abrahamic faith (also known as "God") and Odin.

# Running

# How does it work

Internally, Bless rearranges the bit patterns inside your L1 cache in order to call upon the
supernatural spirit of your choosing.

# Use-cases
